<em>Work in progress guide to developing long form build outs for Indiana Daily Student</em>

<p>This template is developed from <a href="http://specials.idsnews.com/caps/">Waiting for Help</a> published in the Spring of 2015 at the <a href="http://www.idsnews.com">Indiana Daily Student</a>.
It is being developed for stories from Bonnie Layton's multimedia section of the Words and Pictures course at IU in the Fall of 2015 .</p>

<h2>Rules if you're working with the intention to publish in the Indiana Daily Student</h2>
<p>Follow all comment instructions and always call ids.css or ids.js last in your html. 
Make sure to keep our digital desk updated with how your project is going and ask questions early. 
Right now, I'm still developing the template so things are going to be changing quickly. The structure should be figured out
by the end of October. I'm excited if you want a featured added so just let me know if you have any ideas. We have no absolute style
guide online, and you can change anything if you have a justification.</p>

<h2>Working Notes</h2>
<p>This is still early and informal, so things are likely to change as I figure out what you guy's need more or less of.
I'm going to try to never get rid of a feature once it is mentioned here unless it conflicts with another more needed one.
Also since there's a wide range of experience in the class, I'm going to try include a lot of my thought process and some working notes 
below if that's helpful. Please let me know if you want more or less info on anything. I tend to ramble so sorry if this gets long.</p>
