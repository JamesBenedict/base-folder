		<div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-7 body-copy">
			<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>his template is adapted from <a href="http://specials.idsnews.com/caps/"> Waiting for Help</a> published in the Spring of 2015 at the <a href="http://www.idsnews.com">Indiana Daily Student</a>. It is being developed for stories from Bonnie Layton's multimedia section of the Words and Pictures course at IU in the Fall of 2015. </p>

			<p>Read and follow all comments in the html if you wish to publish at the IDS. Call in ids.css and ids.js last in your page unless you are using another plugin that requires its file to be loaded last. If something isn't changing after you style it in the style.css, it might be that the ids.css is over riding it. If this is the case, you can ask to alter the ids.css style, but you need a justification.</p>

			<p>This template was developed to provide a starting point for designers looking to publish their first responsive article. I tried to keep it simple and have it serve as a skeleton for your design. Try to come up with some ideas that differentiate your article from the rest, but keep the overall feel the same. This index.html has every currently available feature, so it will take a while to load and might lag. Make sure to start from the starter folder and do not edit this one, because if you do your article might have uneeded javascript and media files which could cause lag.
			</p>

			<a name="started"></a>

			<h3>Getting Started</h3>

			<p>Download the <a href="https://github.com/JamesBenedict/ids-buildout-template">template folder</a> from github. You can either download the folder as a zip or setup github and fork it. If you're confused about github and want to use it come into office hours. Github is very powerful and has a lot of cool features that I have no idea really how to use. I just use it for backing up my code and making it easier to share. This level of understanding is pretty easy to figure out. 
			</p>

			<p>There will be a starter folder in the template. Pull it out of the template folder and rename it your storyâ€™s slug. Don't change the template folderâ€™s files but keep it as a resource to copy paste from. If anything does break, you can always redownload the folder. The starter folder only has the basics in it to keep it light and load fast.
			</p>

			<p>Try to only work on a few things at a time and work on them until they are functional. Don't leave a bunch of half finished features you plan on finalizing later. Since this is a collaborative project make sure to comment your code well on anything you donâ€™t think makes sense. 
			</p>

			<p>I normally start by placing my section heads and linking them into the nav bar. Then I move onto placing the first draft of the copy, before starting to layout the media. 
			</p>

			<p>The storyâ€™s structure will change around during the editing process so don't get too caught up on the exact layout of everything. Instead try to break the story down into modules that are easy to copy and paste around. Sometimes this is base on the article's sectoin heads, sometimes it is based around graphics. You know your story best and can make the call. I often have a comment before and after code modules that might switch around so I quickly can figure out where it starts and where it ends. Think about building with legos not bricks.

			<h3>Media Categories</h3>
			<p>There are two categories your media falls into. Figure media requires a figure tag around it and a figcaption to explain what it is. HTML media doesn't require a figure tag although it can be place in one if you want. HTML media is place in custom divs you or I have made. In general, html content scales size easier, but figure content is quicker to setup.</p>

			<h4>Figure media includes</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>images</li>
				<li>videos</li>
				<li>audio</li>
				<li>embedded content</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>HTML media includes</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>body copy</li>
				<li>pulled quotes</li>
				<li>more info box</li>
				<li>related content box</li>
				<li>slideshows</li>
				<li>graphics</li>
				<li>stylized text</li>
				<li>maps</li>
				<li>timelines</li>
				<li>soundcite</li>
				<li>storymaps</li>
				<li>anything else you request</li>
			</ul>

			<a name="placement"></a>
			<h3>Media Placement</h3>
				<p>The grid of this article on a medium or larger screen is one body-copy column that is 7 columns wide with one column offset to the left, and one sidebar column that is 4 columns wide. For mobile, everything is the full 12 colunmns wide. These columns live in a row which can be used to organize sections of your code. You can copy in as many columns into a row as you want, but once the total width of the columns equals 12, any other columns will float underneath. Since everything floats to the top, the easiest way to lineup the sidebar with the body-copy is to start a body-copy column on the paragraph that you want to line up the sidebar with. Then include the sidebar underneath and the sidebar will float and line up with the top of the first paragraph or first media in the body-copy column. If you want to read more about the grid structure, read about <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html">Bootstrap scaffolding</a>.</p>
		
				<p>Any media can be placed in one of three areas - inline, sidebar on break. Inline is in the body copy column, sidebar is obviously in the sidebar and break breaks from the row and gives you access to make something the full screen width. You can technically add more options by making divs in the columns a different percentage width (width: 50%, 150%, etc.) if you need a work around. Try to avoid doing this if you can, but often when making graphics something doesn't line up quite right and you need a little more freedom. Stay away from absolute values (width: 50px) as they are more buggy when coding a responsive design unless something is small like styling the twitter button to width: 5px, since this doesn't need to change when loaded on a mobile device.</p>

				<p>If you want to animate your media, look at <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">animate.css</a> and <a href="http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/">wow.js</a> to reveal those animations when scrolled over. Look at my story about <a href="specials.idsnews.com/yaolin">Yaolin Wang's murder</a> or <a href="https://github.com/IU-Student-Media/specials/tree/master/yaolin">check out the code</a> to see a working example of both.</p>

				<p> Figure media lives in figure tags. Suprsing I know. Figures are boxes that keep your media and caption grouped together. It also provides a margin around them to give it some space.</p>

			<a name="images"></a>

				<p>Save images as either jpg or gifs. Follow the photo optimization Bonnie teaches you in class.</p>

			<h3>Audio</h3>
				<p>The default audio play for HTMl kind of sucks in my opinion, but you can include plain audio files  this way.</p>

				<figure>
					<audio controls>
					  <source src="audio/example.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
					Your browser does not support the audio element.
					</audio>
				</figure>

				<p>For longer audio pieces, I would upload them to soundcloud and then embed this file in a figure tag.</p>

				<figure>
					<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/190194548&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>
				</figure>

				<p>You can also use soundcite, which is examplained later on in this template.</p>

				
				<h5>Features to Change</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>add in audio slideshows (for now plan on making a video for them)</li>
				</ul>
				<hr>

			<a name="embeded"></a>
			<h3>Embeded</h3>
				<p>Some content you're just going to want to embed from another service. I highly encourage this and have listed some programs below of things I think are useful. If you do this though, you need to able to create the embeded content on an offical IDS account, so we don't loose access to it next semester. I'd recommend that you make a version on an account you control and then work with a digi editor to export it to an IDS account. Don't try to reinvent the wheel, chances are if google has developed something that does what you're trying to do, it is going to work better than something you make yourself. Many sevices will have an embed option under their share menu, and will generate an iframe for you to paste over. Just copy that into the figure tag, and add a figcaption. Sometimes the sizing is a little wonky, so you might need to adjust width="100%" and play with the height until it looks good.</p>

					<p><a href="https://soundcite.knightlab.com/">Soundcite</a> is a tool developed by the knightlab. Follow the instructions on the website to set up your audio.</p>

					<p>I like it for small audio ques like this <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ids/60208_exampleo.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="0" data-plays="1">pop.</span> or for scence setting.</p>

			<h3>timeline</h3>
				<p> <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/">Timeline</a> is another tool developed by the knightlab that allows you to make an interactive timeline with out javascript knowledge.

					<figcaption>A timeline example from a story about IUBB arrests I did last semester. Since there was nothing in the sidebar and it would look better if it stretched out to fill more of the screen, I put the inline-wide class on the figure so that the figure's width='150%'. This is an example of when to use width stretching over redoing the grid.</figcaption>

			<h3>storymap</h3>
				<p> <a href="https://storymap.knightlab.com/">Storymap</a> is the final knightlab tool with on this site. It is still in beta, and is definitly buggy so if you're having problems working with it come talk to me.</p>
				<p>It also takes up a lot of memory, and requires mutliple steps to make even a generic example, so I'm not including one here. If you want to see what a final product looks like,<a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/multimedia/2014/3/map-timeline-malaysiaairlinesflight370.html"> look at this.</a></p>

				<p>Pulled quotes are a prewritten style that lives in the ids.css file. I tend to put them in the sidebar, but that is just my styles so feel free to put htme anywhere.

			<h3>Interactive Charts</h3>

			<p>Interactive charts are developed with the <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/demo">highcharts.js</a> library. You can work from the templates available on highcharts website, but when you actually load the charts into your page locally host them. If you're confused how to convert the examples you work with online into a local javascript file come talk with me and I can help. It is pretty simple and is mainly copy and pasting things over, but it confusing to explain in writing.</p>

			<h3>Leaflet / Mapbox Map</h3>

			<p>For smaller maps that wouldn't require the use of google fusion tables, I recommnend using mapbox/leaflet maps. It will load quicker and look better since it is locally hosted and you can alter the style. Leaflet is a library built ontop of mapbox created to make it easier and faster to create maps. But now <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">mapbox also has an online graphic user interface </a> that makes it  simpler to use as well. The javascript might seem a little intimidating, but if you're confused come talk with me and we can walk through it.</p>

It was created using their <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/projects/">GUI editor</a>, which can easily be exported for use in a locally hosted version.

			<h3>Guidelines for IDS Submission</h3>

			<p>Follow all commented instructions and call ids.css and ids.js last in your html. There is no absolute style rulebook, and we're open to changes as long as you have a compelling justification.</p>

			<p>Try to keep the digital desk updated on your story throughout your reporting and not just when you're ready to publish. You should start working with us directly three weeks before publication, Iâ€™ve included outline with deadlines for each week included in the next section. </p>

			<p>The earlier we know how you're going to tell the story the better it will work online. I'm excited if you want a featured added so just let me know if you have any ideas. We will likely be debugging eight to ten stories at the end of the semester, so we need to already be familiar with your code and its issues before then.
			</p>

			<p>When youâ€™re designing your story, keep all your files in your project folder. Story structures jump around, and photos get swapped out late so it is best to have everything in your folder even though it will be large. Still optimize your images for the web, donâ€™t have duplicates, etc. but if there is a chance it will be needed in the final project keep it in. We will work to get your folder slim before publishing.
			</p>

			<p>We host everything on github, but if you're not comfortable working with it you can also just give us your code via email or a thumb drive. It can't include any server-side programming like Ruby, Python, PHP, etc. but I don't imagine you would ever need to. All project folders must be less than 80MB. There is a lot of extra javascript in the template folder as it shows you every option available. The starter folder is trimmed down so start working from there. 
			</p>

			<h4>File Optimization</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Save for web like Bonnie has taught (2x pixels you want with low compression rate) </li>
				<li>Before publishing, we will host the photos on our CMSâ€™s photo server via gryphon. You need to work with an editor who has access to gryphon to upload your image. Try talking with James Benedict, Anna Boone, Bari Goldman, Katelyn Rowe or Rachel Meert to upload.</li>
				<li>Use recommended services to host other media</li>
				<li>More info to come</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Schedule and Deadlines</h3>

				<p>Start working with our desk roughly three weeks before you want to publish. If you meet a deadline early you can move on to the next week.
				</p>

				<h4>Week 1</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Submit your article <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QeoXau5Ei1ZxBudCG72IKHDZvnaedjxyjayBAAHihCg/viewform">at this pitchlist</a> as other: buildout and include:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>A working headline and slug. Both can change if needed, but the slug will show up in the URL so make sure it isnâ€™t insensitive.</li>
							<li>A general list of the media you have (e.g. 2 maps, one chart, an audio slideshow and a couple photos).</li>
							<li>Contact info of everyone working on the story.</li>
							<li>When you want it to publish. If youâ€™re unsure about the specific date, just put the Monday of the week you want to publish. </li>
						</ul>
					<li>Make sure youâ€™re signed up for our <a href="https://jamesbenedict.slack.com/messages">slack account</a> so we can be in communication throughout the editing process.</li>
					<li>Come into an office hour (M/W 3-4 p.m.) or schedule a time to meet with me to discuss your story. Think of ideas you want to include in your story that you couldnâ€™t figure out or any big challenges youâ€™re nervous about. We will also go through how to get started with the folder. </li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Week 2</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Use the starter folder and copy-paste over examples from the template folder. If you run into issues getting things to work properly send us a message on slack. We might be able to identify the problem or send you a code snippet to fix it.</li>
					<li>Come into office hours or schedule a time to meet me to discuss more complicated problems.</li>
					<li>By the end of the week submit a first draft of your article. If you need / want to use lorem ipsum text thatâ€™s fine but have your media layed out in the correct hierarchy.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Week 3</h4>
				<p>We need a full week to edit your code, so make sure to submit a rough draft a five days before your publication date. Every day has specific deadlines this week. You can come into the IDS to work if you want hands on help, or can submit folders remotely. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Day 5
						<ul>
							<li>Tell us about major bugs or style problems you havenâ€™t been able to figure out. </li>
							<li>Come in to receive an edited rough draft. You will receive two to do lists, one for bugs and other to make it comply with the ids style guide.</li>
							<li>Submit a final slug for use in the url of your website.</li>
							<li>Consider reaching out to experts or subjects in your story for promotion on social media. Tell them you plan to publish in a week and ask would they retweet or share your story on facebook. Try sharing your story in multiple niche circles where it will gain the best traction online. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li> Day 4
						<ul>
							<li>Update your style and submit a new version that complies with the ids style guide.</li>
							<li>Start debugging</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li> Day 3
						<ul>
							<li>More debugging</li>
							<li>Remove any features that still arenâ€™t working by the end of the day.</li>
							<li></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li> Day 2
						<ul>
							<li>Submit a debugged version. It should work on mobile, medium and large screens. If graphics or features arenâ€™t working, they should be removed and a fully functional version submitted. If you are able to get them working before publication you can go back in and add it in, but we want a stable version that we know we can publish this day.</li>
							<li>Push your folder to our server so it is live. </li>
							<li>Make a list of problems discovered once the article went live. Normally these are small like a .js file being called in wrong, or an image being locally hosted somewhere outside the project folder.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Day 1 (night of production):
						<ul>
							<li>Place in copy edited copy and captions.</li>
							<li>Fix any issues found when the article went live.</li>
							<li>Possibly add in fixed features that were removed the day before.</li>
							<li>Prepare article for social media.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li> Day 0 (day is appears in the paper)
						<ul>
							<li>Sleep</li>
							<li>Try to be available to contact if other problems pop up or the story gains a lot of traction online.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
